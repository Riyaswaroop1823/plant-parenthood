Now that you have some plants in your collection, you will see them here! Each plant also displays a message notify you how many days are left before you need to water your plant again. After you have watered your plant, you can click the water icon to tell the app you have taken care of your plant!

### AddPlant

If you are an expert plant owner and want to manually add your own plants, you are able to do so in the Add Plants section of our app!

### Feed

The Plant Parenthood Feed is a place where you can publically share images of your plant for other plant owners to see. This is a great outlet for your plant photos if your friends complain that you spam too many plant photos to your Instagram.

## Roadmap

  - Extended Social Media
  - Personal Profile Page
  - Add friends
  - Push notifications for watering via GCal integration
  - Sharing watering schedule
