Plant Parenthood is a mobile-first app centered around new plant parents looking to adopt a plant into their life, or expert plant parents looking for a way to keep track of their needs. Features include plant discovery, plant management which includes a watering schedule, social media image feed, and manual plant entry.

Now that you have some plants in your collection, you will see them here! Each plant also displays a message notify you how many days are left before you need to water your plant again.

The Plant Parenthood Feed is a place where you can publically share images of your plant for other plant owners to see. This is a great outlet for your plant photos if your friends complain that you spam too many plant photos to your Instagram.
